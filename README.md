# CRUD_Base
This is a simple JavaScript-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that stores data in the browser's localStorage. It allows users to add, edit, and delete items dynamically â€” without any backend or database connection.

1.Add new items
2.Edit existing items
3. Delete items
4. Persistent data using localStorage
5. Modular and clean code
6. Foundation for scaling to larger apps (e.g., bank dashboard, todo app, note keeper)
